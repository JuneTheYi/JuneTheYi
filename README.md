# About Me

HiðŸ‘‹, I'm June Yi and welcome to my GitHub page.

:computer:I'm a recently transitioned Software Engineer Student at Lambda School in the process of learning backend development using Java. 

:boom:I graduated from United States Military Academy in 2010 and served as an Army Officer for 8 years. When I got out in 2018, I had no clue what I wanted to do with my career. I experimented around as a consultant in various companies including Accenture and Deloitte where I became passionate about technology. Despite working with amazing teams solving interesting problems, I always felt something was lacking while working on various projects.

:star:In early 2021, I realized that I wanted to be closer to building the product as much as possible. What better way to do that than learning to code. This is just the beginning of my story.
