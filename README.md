# About Me

HiðŸ‘‹, I'm June Yi and welcome to my GitHub page.

:boom: I graduated from United States Military Academy in 2010 and served as an Army Officer for 8 years. When I got out in 2018, I had no clue what I wanted to do with my career. I experimented around as a consultant in various companies including Accenture and Deloitte where I became passionate about technology. Despite working with amazing teams solving interesting problems, I always felt something was lacking while working on various projects.

:computer: In early 2021, I realized that I wanted to be closer to building the product as much as possible and enrolled in a Backend Development Bootcamp where I learned to code in Java.

:star: Since then, I've been immersed in this field on a daily basis trying to learn as much as possible. Feel free to DM if you want to chat.
